# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes and the `Outlet` component in React Router v6. The problem arises when components within nested routes don't update their state correctly after route changes, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.

## Problem

The primary problem is that data in nested components may not be properly updated when navigation occurs. This commonly manifests as stale data being displayed, or the wrong component rendering entirely.

## Solution

The solution focuses on properly managing state updates within nested routes. This may require refactoring how data is fetched and handled to ensure that when a route changes, the appropriate components re-render with the new data.  We also need to handle cases where the child component's data depends on parameters from the parent route.

This is demonstrated in `bugSolution.jsx`.
