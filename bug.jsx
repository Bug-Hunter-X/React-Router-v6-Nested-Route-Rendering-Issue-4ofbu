In React Router Dom v6, if you're using nested routes and encounter issues with components not rendering or unexpected behavior, it might be due to the way you structure your routes and handle component updates.  Specifically, a common problem occurs when using `Outlet` improperly within nested routes. If the component that uses `Outlet` doesn't update its state correctly after route changes, that would cause unexpected display behaviour.  For example, consider this code:

```jsx
import { Outlet, useOutlet, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function Parent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent</h1>
      <Outlet/>
    </div>
  );
}

function Child() {
  let params = useParams();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Child {params.id}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

```

If you have a complex nested structure and don't update data fetched in child component or manage component state properly, your `Outlet` might not render correctly.
